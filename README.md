# discourse-floating-reply
A plugin to float the Topic Reply button permanently at the foot of the display.

This is broken and support for this is suspended indefintely.  Use https://github.com/merefield/discourse-tc-mobile-floating-reply instead, which does exactly the same thing, but is much more reliable.
